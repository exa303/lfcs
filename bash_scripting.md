# Bash

### FILES

* `-a file` - file exists or its compilation is successful
* `-d file` - file exists and is a directory
* `-e file` - file exists; same -a
* `-f file` - file exists and is a regular file (i.e., not a directory or other special type of file)
* `-r file` - you have read permission
* `-s file` - file exists and is not empty
* `-w file` - your have write permission
* `-x file` - you have execute permission on file, or directory search permission if it is a directory
* `-N file` - file was modified since it was last read
* `-O file` - you own file
* `-G file` - file's group ID matches yours (or one of yours, if you are in multiple groups)
* `file1 -nt file2` -file1 is newer than file2
* `file1 -ot file2` -file1 is older than file2

### NUMBERS

* `-lt` - less than
* `-le` - less than or equal
* `-eq` - equal
* `-ge` - greater than or equal
* `-gt` - greater than
* `-ne` - not equal


### STRINGS

* `str1 == str2` - str1 matches str2
* `str1 != str2` - str1 does not match str2
* `str1 < str2` - str1 is less than str2 (alphabetically)
* `str1 > str2` - str1 is greater than str2 (alphabetically)
* `str1 \> str2` - str1 is sorted after str2
* `str1 \< str2` - str1 is sorted before str2
* `-n str1` - str1 is not null (has length greater than 0)
* `-z str1` - str1 is null (has length 0)

### USER INPUT
     
* `read -p "please enter your name: " name
   echo $name`
	* -p prior

### FLAGS with GETOPTS
```bash
#!/bin/bash
while getopts "n:x" opts; do

        case $opts in
                n) name=$OPTARG ;;
                x) echo "the x has been selected";;
        esac
done

echo "hello $name"
```

### OTHER:

= and == are for string comparisons
-eq is for numeric comparisons
-eq is in the same family as -lt, -le, -gt, -ge, and -ne

== is specific to bash (not present in sh (Bourne shell), ...). Using POSIX = is preferred for compatibility. In bash the two are equivalent, and in sh = is the only one that will work.

* `command && command && command` - Using one & (ampersand) to run commands simultaneously

* `$$` - is the process ID (PID) of the script itself. $BASHPID is the process ID of the current instance of Bash.

* `trap <function name / "or entire command"> <SIGNAL>` - trap execution of a function name or entire command until the SIGNAL is received.
        * `trap -l` - lists all possible signals. In bash scripts you can use `EXIT` signal to trap execution until script exits. It is similar to `defer` in golang.

* `seq 1 10` - start step stop , it can be used in bash scripting in for loop for example:
        
```bash
        for a in `seq 1 10`; do
                echo $a
        done

```
 
* ` ${#array[@]}` - find out total number of elements in array.
* `wait` - useful command when waiting for multiple processes to finish. 

### Arithmetic expressions

* `myvar=3 && echo $myvar && echo $((myvar++))` - Increments
* `a=5 && b=5 && echo $((a * b))` - result is 25



## Colors in bash

* `echo -e "\e[0;31m *** this text should be in red *** \e[0m"` - `\e` escape

**special char's:**

```bash
\\ - backslash
\a - alert (BEL)
\b - backspace
\c - produce no further output
\e - escape
\f - form feed
\n - new line
\r - carriage return
\t - horizontal tab
\v - vertical tab
\0NNN - byte with octal value NNN (1 to 3 digits)
\xHH - byte with hexadecimal value HH (1 to 2 digits)
```

**colors:**
```bash
export COLOR_NC='\e[0m' # No Color
export COLOR_BLACK='\e[0;30m'
export COLOR_GRAY='\e[1;30m'
export COLOR_RED='\e[0;31m'
export COLOR_LIGHT_RED='\e[1;31m'
export COLOR_GREEN='\e[0;32m'
export COLOR_LIGHT_GREEN='\e[1;32m'
export COLOR_BROWN='\e[0;33m'
export COLOR_YELLOW='\e[1;33m'
export COLOR_BLUE='\e[0;34m'
export COLOR_LIGHT_BLUE='\e[1;34m'
export COLOR_PURPLE='\e[0;35m'
export COLOR_LIGHT_PURPLE='\e[1;35m'
export COLOR_CYAN='\e[0;36m'
export COLOR_LIGHT_CYAN='\e[1;36m'
export COLOR_LIGHT_GRAY='\e[0;37m'
export COLOR_WHITE='\e[1;37m'

echo -e "\e[COLOR1;COLOR2m<YOUR TEXT HERE>\e[0m"

```
